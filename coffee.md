I started to drink a ridiculous amount of coffee when I lived in Japan, and I continue to try to drink a reasonable
amount of coffee from new and exciting places now that I'm back in the United States. Below, I compile a list of coffees
that I've had, as well as notes on their flavor and quality.

This page is still pretty meh since it was thrown together pretty quick. <code>undefined</code> abounds.

Unless otherwise noted, I ordered a hot cafe latte with whole milk, if available. If a place does not have
a cafe latte, then I usually reach for a cafe au lait or similar - just something with a little milk so that
it's a nontrivial drink to pour. I also really like
mochas which I realize are entirely different drinks, but I included those anyways since they are also
coffee.

I really like stores that offer second-floor seating. These tend to be larger and commercialized, but it's nice
because you can people watch really easily.

# Sidequests and notes

## Mister Donut Inconsistencies

On my quest to drink as much coffee as I possibly could in Japan, I also stumbled onto a wonderful chain
by the name of Mister Donut. Mister Donut is known for providing the people of Japan with tasty, cheap
donuts, and airport-level coffee. I would compare it to Krispy Kreme, but those exist in Japan too.

It is also incredibly addictive. Even as I write this, having had Mister Donut for two days in a row, I am
craving it again (I got donuts the day after I wrote this sentence). They're just too good. I went so far
as to register for their membership program rather than going through Rakuten Points or dPoints.

I've been traveling around the country quite a bit lately, and part of the quest I've been on has been to
try out different Mister Donuts. Now, you'd think that as a chain, the distribution of donuts available
at each location would be relatively consistent. However, in thinking that, you'd be dead wrong.

My girlfriend was studying in Ibaraki, where I found myself ordering hot royal milk tea at their Mister Donut,
which is just a standard brand of bottled milk tea you can buy at almost any vending machine in Japan. At Mister
Donut, you can get as many refills as you want as long as you eat-in at the restaurant (for which they charge
a nominal price increase on the order of about ~5-10 JPY per donut).

What I failed to realize is how _rare_ that hot royal milk tea is. The only one I found to have it consistently
was in Tsukuba, Ibaraki (about a 1.5 hour train ride from central Tokyo). Every other location I went to in
the greater Tokyo area only offered it iced! And when I asked if they had hot tea, almost every staff member
would reply with a puzzled look like I was describing something that had never existed. Perhaps its a seasonal
relation, too? In the summer months I imagine hot drinks are not very popular.

Anyways, just a strange observation.
