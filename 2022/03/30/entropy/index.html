  <h1>Entropy</h1>
  <p>Frameworks are the heart of the Internet these days. React, Vue, Angular, Next, Svelte, Solid, ... it doesn't really matter. There's a framework getting shoved into your frontend, and it will add some bootstrapped bloat to the site.</p>
<p>Similarly, static linking seems to be the most popular way for building software in modern languages like Rust, Go, Haskell, OCaml, ... Bloat haunts software design. Java sees a hellish amount of design bloat.</p>
<p>But there is also a kind of bloat that pervades language design. Haskell is marred by its <code>{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}</code> pragmas, and C++ seems to be getting the grave robber treatment with its additions of parametric constraints pulled from Go's implicit interfaces. Rust, too, is marked by strange decisions like its implementation of <code>async/await</code>.</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics: the entropy of any closed system cannot decrease.</p>
