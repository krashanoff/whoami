  <p>I have been terminally online since my sophomore year of high school. COVID didn't help much when I had to move back home. I don't exactly live in &quot;the sticks&quot;, but I live far enough away from a major data center that ISPs are comfortable being predatory with us. Ever since high school I've had a hard cap of about a terabyte on monthly data usage. This was not only for me, but for the whole household, which made things difficult.</p>
<p>Every month, I would get an email when we were approaching that data cap. That email had been a staple of every single month.</p>
<p>Things changed pretty drastically in the past month or so, though. For one, I graduated college in March. I moved back home without my desktop, and don't really have a place to be online all day.</p>
<p>I also started full-time work. I have much less time to program for fun. I also had less time to watch anime, or watch Internet videos, or really whatever my hobbies might entail.</p>
<p>You can imagine my surprise when, for the first time in a long time, I didn't get an email from our ISP telling me that we were close to exceeding our monthly data plan.</p>
<p>My browsing habits had changed. Though I had lost my desktop, I had begun using my server more for high-bandwidth jobs that I could offload. I checked this computer far less often, and when I did, it was over SSH.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder about the advantages of a lower bandwidth life. There's less to spread your focus thin and encourages you to use the resources at your disposal. Instead of Googling something, I can just use the manpages or local doc server. Instead of watching the first episode of every seasonal anime, I can just watch a couple episodes of one that already aired, and just chip away at it.</p>
<p>It's attractive enough that I'm contemplating some more drastic changes. I could start taking notes on pen-and-paper again, or journal or something. Maybe I'll revive the old Nokia cell phone we've got sitting around and, with an older MP3 player, and get rid of my smartphone.</p>
<p>Hell, maybe I'll even <em>read a book</em>.</p>
