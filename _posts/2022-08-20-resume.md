*Responsive web design is good, but if you need to use HTML/CSS to format a document for print, the funky real-life units come in handy.*

***

I used a Google Doc to create my resume for quite some time. It was the basic two-column template that shows up on the homepage.

![google docs default resume template]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/resume/gdoc.png)

I also tried using LaTeX to format my resume. There's a slew of templates online. You can imagine how that one went:

![latex template]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/resume/latex.png)

But there's all sorts of specific units in CSS. There's `em`, `px`, `vw`, `vh`, ... There's also `pt`, `in`, or `cm`. Imagine that: *inches* in **web design**! That would absolutely butcher the webpage between viewports. What about vertical monitors? I don't even want to think about cell phones. Responsive design is the name of the game in the era of flexbox and SPAs. There is no place for `<table>`s for formatting or inches as a unit of measure. Not in the HTML/CSS era I grew up in.

You know what those units are great for? **Text documents.**

```css
body {
  width: 8.5in;
  height: 11in;
  font-size: 12pt;
  margin: 0.5in;
}
```

Your webpage is now U.S. letter stock in 12pt font with a half-inch margin. But I'll do you one better. We can limit the amount of content printed to the page with an `@media` query[^1]:

```css
@media print
{
  .noprint {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

This lets us control what actually shows up in the printed copy. I ended up using these techniques to make my [current resume]({{ '/resume' | url }}).
