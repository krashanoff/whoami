title: Kuroneko (Shindo, 1968)
---

This was my first [Kaneto Shindo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaneto_Shindo) movie. It is not so much a horror movie as much as it is a mystery and a tragedy. It was enjoyable. I also watched its special feature, an interview with prominent Japanese film critic [Tadao Sato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Sato).

The film's cinematography relies on saturated nighttime shots taken on high-speed monochrome film. The resulting frames fade its environments into screen from pitch black, and superimpose characters to almost force them into existence, as though they were foreign objects.

This movie is noted for its use of special effects. I felt they were best applied in nondescript ways, particularly around the home in which the two ghosts lived. In quietly dissolving the stark boundaries created in their physical film, the composite environment's ethereality is more tangible.

Some of the special effects used in combat sequences are far more apparent and visually noisy, but they evoke a sense of panic that I felt was beneficial.

In terms of the story the film tells, I understood it to be a confrontation with survivor's guilt, postwar trauma, and balancing that internalized struggle with societal expectations -- common themes in Japanese art.

The story is presented effectively. It felt as though I was watching a well-documented theatre act. Many critics have pointed out influences in this movie from [Noh theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh).

Touching back on the commentary special feature associated with this film on the Criterion Channel, I found myself in agreement with Sato's thoughts on the more feminist aspects of the film. The women of Kuroneko are portrayed almost as forces of nature, with incredible agency. The female protagonists internalize and suffer through the same struggles experienced by all characters in the film, but with more extreme consequences demanding all the more strength of will.

Also worth noting is that the men of Kuroneko are not depicted as particularly strong, nor are they a force for good. This finds some resonance in modern arthouse Japanese filmmakers, e.g. Iwai.[^1] Also noted by Sato, Shindo's critical portrayal of the samurai class is something to dwell on while viewing. It is unusual to the era of cinema in which Kuroneko was released.
