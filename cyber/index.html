<p><strong>Note: this portion of my website is under heavy construction! However, there's still some useful information here about certain aspects of NIST 800-38 and the high-level overview of FIPS 140-3.</strong></p>

<p>Howdy! You can imagine my surprise as a fresh grad when I discovered that computer security in industry -- when you get down to it -- is just documentation and the people who read, write, and implement it.</p>
<p>The big one in the United States for information protection is the <strong>Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)</strong>. The 140-X (where X is some number) family of documents set the <s>terribly long-winded</s> necessarily specific bar on cryptography standards for the US and Canadian governments. FIPS, though, is really just a body of lengthier documents published by the <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong> applied as adjustments to an <em>even lengthier</em> <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/52906.html">ISO specification</a>.</p>
<p>I'll likely focus on this standard and explaining it in sensible, cliff notes-style language. I'm hardly an expert -- the amount of documentation and person-hours that go into this is insane -- but I have found that learning about it is actually pretty fun.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a very brief overview of the documents and their purpose, please refer to the <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> of this document.</p>

<p>As opposed to the much catchier &quot;NIST in a Nutshell&quot;. Out of an abundance of caution for misrepresenting the NIST in any way, I want to make it clear: the actual name of the series is not <strong>&quot;NIST IN A NUTSHELL&quot;</strong>. It is <strong>NOT</strong> &quot;NIST in a Nutshell&quot;.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Doc</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Purpose and synopsis</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>38A</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Legacy special publication describing cryptographic modes of operation. ECB, CBC, CF, OF, and counter modes. Also contains some recommendations for padding data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>38G</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Rather than 38aâ€™s five modes of operation, describes two. FF1 and FF3. Both modes are general-purpose, and utilize a common block cipher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>56A</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Key-agreement. Essentially, DH or Noise-like protocols.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>56B</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Key-establishment. This is a high-level description of Diffie-Hellman with trusted third-party (TTP) assurance. Assurance requirements are described in section 6 of this document.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>56C</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Key-derivation. Describes how a valid key-derivation function is implemented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>57</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Key management. How to store and handle short-term, long-term, permanent, or ephemeral cryptographic keys. Also covers some information on how to handle RBG seeds, passwords, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90A</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Random bit generator proper use and entropy management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90B</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Entropy source health tests and validation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131A</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Transitioning the government to use elliptic curve cryptography as standard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td style="text-align:left">How to derive keying material from a password using a Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF), taking the password, length of the key, and a salt as input.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Description of how key pairs should be generated. There are many ways to generate symmetric keys, but only a few to generate asymmetric ones.</td>
</tr>
