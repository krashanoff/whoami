        <p>
            Hey there, <span class='brighter'>I'm Leo, a third year computer science undergrad at UCLA.</span> I write software.
            <br /><br />
            I tend to enjoy working on lower level stuff but I have a considerable amount of experience in fullstack and web development. In my free time, I study Japanese and write code for ants.
            <br /><br />
            If you're interested in what I'm up to, you can find a list of the big stuff below. If you're looking for the code behind my projects or my open source work, take a peek at my <a href='https://github.com/krashanoff' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>. If you're looking to get in touch with me, feel free to reach me via the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/contact'>contact</a> link up top.
