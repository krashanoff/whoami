    <p>Welcome to my unorganized reading list where I capture a few of the highlights of things I read or discover in an indeterminate period of time. I could probably make this into a mailing list in the future.</p>
<h2 id="archaeology" tabindex="-1">archaeology</h2>
<p>Been reading the 2nd edition of &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;. It's interesting to see how such a simple language has
persisted through the years relatively unchanged compared to the insane additions bolted onto C++.</p>
<h2 id="the-emperor-has-no-source-control" tabindex="-1">the emperor has no source control</h2>
<p>Postfix has no source control and it is the definitive mail server. <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.postfix.users/c/6Kkel3J_nv4">https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.postfix.users/c/6Kkel3J_nv4</a></p>
<p>This isn't a bad thing. It's cool to see such a successful project maintained without use of Git.</p>
<p>It also has wonderful documentation <a href="https://www.postfix.org/documentation.html">https://www.postfix.org/documentation.html</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gn" tabindex="-1">gn</h2>
<p>I've been studying some of the WebRTC source. The build system they use is the same as Chromium, which I hadn't used before. <code>gn</code> is a very clever tool.</p>

<h2 id="popularity-contest" tabindex="-1">popularity contest</h2>
<p>I don't like the direction GitHub and &quot;mainstream&quot; open source is heading. Stars are starting to feel like Instagram likes to me.</p>
<p>I feel like if you're going to publish open source software, you should just put it out there and let it live. We could all stand to learn from <a href="https://bellard.org/">Fabrice</a>. See: <a href="https://smartbear.com/blog/2011/fabrice-bellard-portrait-of-a-super-productive-pro/?lang=de-de">Fabrice Bellard: Portrait of a Super-Productive Programmer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rust-in-usgov" tabindex="-1">rust in usgov</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Stroustrup gets upset at Microsoft and the United States Government backing Rust instead of C++. <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2739r0.pdf">https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2739r0.pdf</a>
<ul>
<li>And associated commentary <a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/story/23/01/21/0526236/rust-safety-is-not-superior-to-c-bjarne-stroustrup-says">https://developers.slashdot.org/story/23/01/21/0526236/rust-safety-is-not-superior-to-c-bjarne-stroustrup-says</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Linus hates C++ <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/249460/">https://lwn.net/Articles/249460/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Disclosure: I do not have any strong opinion about C++. It is an excellent compromise between modern language features and C-like aphorisms. I do believe that it is a complicated language, however.

<h2 id="sourcehut-exploration" tabindex="-1">sourcehut exploration</h2>
<p>Stumbled onto this cool project Muon, which is a C99 implementation of Meson, which is normally implemented in
Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/~lattis/muon/">https://sr.ht/~lattis/muon/</a></p>
<p>The person who wrote it, Stone, also wrote a ray tracer in Meson's build language, then used that to compare
the performance of their build system to Meson's reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://mochiro.moe/posts/09-meson-raytracer/">https://mochiro.moe/posts/09-meson-raytracer/</a></p>
<p>The project has its docs generated using another cool tool, scdoc:</p>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/">https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/</a></p>
<p>It's a bit niche. There are more general-purpose tools like pandoc and <code>groff</code> that could get the job done.</p>
<p>Hilariously, there's another implementation of the Meson build system in C11 on the same source tracker.</p>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/~bl4ckb0ne/boson/">https://sr.ht/~bl4ckb0ne/boson/</a></p>
<h2 id="twitter-is-in-a-weird-spot%3B-activitypub" tabindex="-1">twitter is in a weird spot; activitypub</h2>
<p>Reading a decent amount about ActivityPub and its issues since Twitter is currently destroying (or at least losing) its userbase.</p>
