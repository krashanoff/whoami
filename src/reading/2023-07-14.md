Welcome to my unorganized reading list where I capture a few of the highlights of things I read or discover in an indeterminate period of time. I could probably make this into a mailing list in the future.

## archaeology

Been reading the 2nd edition of "The C Programming Language". It's interesting to see how such a simple language has
persisted through the years relatively unchanged compared to the insane additions bolted onto C++.

## the emperor has no source control

Postfix has no source control and it is the definitive mail server. https://groups.google.com/g/mailing.postfix.users/c/6Kkel3J_nv4

This isn't a bad thing. It's cool to see such a successful project maintained without use of Git.

It also has wonderful documentation https://www.postfix.org/documentation.html.

## gn

I've been studying some of the WebRTC source. The build system they use is the same as Chromium, which I hadn't used before. `gn` is a very clever tool.

## popularity contest

I don't like the direction GitHub and "mainstream" open source is heading. Stars are starting to feel like Instagram likes to me.

I feel like if you're going to publish open source software, you should just put it out there and let it live. We could all stand to learn from [Fabrice](https://bellard.org/). See: [Fabrice Bellard: Portrait of a Super-Productive Programmer](https://smartbear.com/blog/2011/fabrice-bellard-portrait-of-a-super-productive-pro/?lang=de-de).

## rust in usgov

* Dr. Stroustrup gets upset at Microsoft and the United States Government backing Rust instead of C++. https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2739r0.pdf
  * And associated commentary https://developers.slashdot.org/story/23/01/21/0526236/rust-safety-is-not-superior-to-c-bjarne-stroustrup-says
* Linus hates C++ https://lwn.net/Articles/249460/

Disclosure: I do not have any strong opinion about C++. It is an excellent compromise between modern language features and C-like aphorisms. I do believe that it is a complicated language, however. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern

## sourcehut exploration

Stumbled onto this cool project Muon, which is a C99 implementation of Meson, which is normally implemented in
Python.

https://sr.ht/~lattis/muon/

The person who wrote it, Stone, also wrote a ray tracer in Meson's build language, then used that to compare
the performance of their build system to Meson's reference.

https://mochiro.moe/posts/09-meson-raytracer/

The project has its docs generated using another cool tool, scdoc:

https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/

It's a bit niche. There are more general-purpose tools like pandoc and `groff` that could get the job done.

Hilariously, there's another implementation of the Meson build system in C11 on the same source tracker.

## twitter is in a weird spot; activitypub

Reading a decent amount about ActivityPub and its issues since Twitter is currently destroying (or at least losing) its userbase.
