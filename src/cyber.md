# WIP: Notes on Cybersecurity

<small>Last updated: <date>{{ last_updated | datePlain }}</date></small>

Howdy! You can imagine my surprise as a fresh grad when I discovered that computer security in industry -- when you get down to it -- is just documentation and the people who read, write, and implement it.

The big one in the United States for information protection is the **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)**. The 140-X (where X is some number) family of documents set the ~~terribly long-winded~~ necessarily specific bar on cryptography standards for the US and Canadian governments. FIPS, though, is really just a body of lengthier documents published by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** applied as adjustments to an *even lengthier* [ISO specification](https://www.iso.org/standard/52906.html).

I'll likely focus on this standard and explaining it in sensible, cliff notes-style language. I'm hardly an expert -- the amount of documentation and person-hours that go into this is insane -- but I have found that learning about it is actually pretty fun.

If you are interested in a very brief overview of the documents and their purpose, please refer to the [appendix](#appendix) of this document.

## Special Publications in a Nutshell

As opposed to the much catchier "NIST in a Nutshell". Out of an abundance of caution for misrepresenting the NIST in any way, I want to make it clear: the actual name of the series is not **"NIST IN A NUTSHELL"**. It is **NOT** "NIST in a Nutshell".

## Appendix

### NIST 800 Document Overview

All documents are in NIST's 800 series of publications.

Doc | Purpose and synopsis
-|:-
38A | Legacy special publication describing cryptographic modes of operation. ECB, CBC, CF, OF, and counter modes. Also contains some recommendations for padding data.
38G | Rather than 38aâ€™s five modes of operation, describes two. FF1 and FF3. Both modes are general-purpose, and utilize a common block cipher.
56A | Key-agreement. Essentially, DH or Noise-like protocols.
56B | Key-establishment. This is a high-level description of Diffie-Hellman with trusted third-party (TTP) assurance. Assurance requirements are described in section 6 of this document.
56C | Key-derivation. Describes how a valid key-derivation function is implemented.
57 | Key management. How to store and handle short-term, long-term, permanent, or ephemeral cryptographic keys. Also covers some information on how to handle RBG seeds, passwords, etc.
90A | Random bit generator proper use and entropy management.
90B | Entropy source health tests and validation.
131A | Transitioning the government to use elliptic curve cryptography as standard.
132 | How to derive keying material from a password using a Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF), taking the password, length of the key, and a salt as input.
133 | Description of how key pairs should be generated. There are many ways to generate symmetric keys, but only a few to generate asymmetric ones.
