The acronym "CISA" stands for two big things in the cybersecurity world (at least from my perspective):
1. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
2. Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is responsible for distributing resources and information to the public about cybersecurity, and helping to secure and safeguard the United States' digital infrastructure against digital threats.

The term "Certified Information Systems Auditor" (CISA) is the name of a certification offering from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) for IT professionals.
